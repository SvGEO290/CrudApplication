# CrudApplication1

For this application, I have created a simple CRUD app that can:

- Prompt the user for the creation of new data.
- Can read and display previously created data. 
- Is able to update and delete existing data. 

The application uses a text file for the data, the text file that is already loaded in the directory is data.txt, this text file has the ID, and has a name following it. 

If you were to delete a set of data, you would simply provide the application the ID. 
If you were to create and add to the set of data, you would make an ID number and then provide a name.
You can refresh the data by choosing the option to view it after every entry or deletion of data.
